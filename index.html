        <p>
                American Football can be a very confusing sport to understand. 
            In this short page I (a 17 year highschooler with a VERY rudimentery 
            understanding of the sport), will attempt to teach you the basics of 
            this great sport. There are three different "sides" to football: 
            offense, defense, and special teams. I will cover each one more in depth
            in there respective sections. The main goal of the game is to outscore
            your opponent by scoring more points. points may be scored through
            touchdowns, field goals, and Point after attempts
            (or PATs). There are four quarters in game. Each is 15 minutes long.
            The game ends after each of the four quarters has been played as long
            as one team has more points than the other one. In the event
            that both teams are tied when the clock runs out the game goes into
            overtime. Overtime rules differ by leagues so I won't be giving an in
            depth overview.

                The offense is perhaps the most loved side of football. The
            offense's main goal is to score touchdowns. They do this by running
            plays. A play is initiated when a center tosses or "snaps"
            the ball to a player, usually a quarterback or running back.
            The play continues until 1. The ball is thrown forward and hits
            the ground without being caught by another player 2. A player
            currently in possesion of the ball is tackled 3. The player
            currently in possesion of the ball steps out of bounds 4. A ref
            whistles the play "dead" for any reason. A offense gets four plays to get 10 yards. If after four plays the offense fails to get 10 yards it is "turnover on downs" meaning the opposing team gets the ball at the same position as the offense. Most teams will elect to punt or kick a field goal on their fourth try or down. There are many different
            plays a team can run but the in the most basic sense there are two 
            different kinds of plays, runs and passes. In a pass play a quarterback
            snaps the ball signaling the start of the play. The recievers, tight ends
            and sometimes the running back run "routes" to try and get open.
            Routes are paths that recievers take that are agreed upon before hand.
            Routes are where much of the creativity of football is expressed with an
            inumerable combination of routes being used by teams to try and confuse
            the defense. While the recievers are trying to get open the defense 
            is trying to "sack" the quarterback or try to tackle him before 
            he throws the ball. This is prevented by the offensive line who
            attempt to block these players from getting to the quarterback.
            Occasionally a tight end or running back will be told to block
            as well. The second main type of play is a running play. Usually 
            during a running play a quarterback will snap the ball before 
            handing it to a running back. all other players are usually setting
            blocks to prevent the ball carrier from being tackled. Occasionally
            a quarterback will keep the ball and run himself. If the offense manages
            to work there way down the field and score a touchdown they will
            net six points. After a touch down a PAT is attempted there are two
            types of PATs a kick and a two point conversion. A kick is done by a 
            special teams unit, while a two point conversion is done by the offense.
            Most teams simply kick, but on the rare occasion a two point attempt is made
            the offense will have one down to score a "touchdown". If succesful they
            net two points.

        <p>
                The defense is on the field at the same time as the offense. 
            The defenses main goal is to stop the offense from scoring. 
            They do this by stratically positioning players to defend against
            both pass and run plays. The defense ideally keeps the offense from
            ever completing a pass, but in the event the offense does complete opponent
            the defense must then tackle the player. A tackle is considered succesful
            if the ball carriers forearm, elbow, shoulder, back, head, calf, quad,
            or chest touch the ground. The defense has two main sides the secondary
            and the rush attack the secondary is comprised of cornerbacks and safeties, and linebackers
            the secondaries main objective is to stop a pass if the ball is thrown. The rush
            attack is comprised of the defensive line, edge rushers, and Occasionally
            linebackers and cornerbacks. The rush attacks main goal is to tackle the 
            ball carrier before the ball is thrown or carried for a touch down.
            The defense may force turnovers. A turnover gives the ball two the 
            defense's offense There are three kinds of turnovers.
            A turnover on downs is when the offense uses all 4 downs or chances
            before gaining 10 yards. An interception is when a defensive player
            catches a ball that was thrown by the opposing quarterback. A fumble
            occurs when the ball is knocked out of the hands of an opposing player
            before they are tackled.

        <h2 id="specialT">Special Teams</h2>
        <img src="resources/images/kickerImg.jfif" height= 170 width= 350/>
        <p>
            Special teams is a special unit of players who's tasks involve
            either punting or kicking. A punt is preformed on fourth down,
            although technically it can be done on any down there is just
            no benifit to doing it before fourth down. A punt gives the ball
            to the other team, but it allows the punting team to push the 
            opposing team's starting position farther back. When punting, a 
            long snapper snaps the ball to a punter who then holds out 
            the ball, drops it, and kicks it to the other team. The other
            team may then catch the ball and return it up the field for
            better field position. The team may also call for a fair catch,
            which means the play is called dead when the ball is caught, but 
            the opposing team is not allowed to touch the recieving player.
            A kickoff is similar to a punt. It is preformed after a team scores 
            or at the beginning of a half or the beginning of overtime. Instead
            of the ball being snapped the ball is kicked of a Tee by a kicker.
            A field goal is a three point attempt by a team. When kicking the 
            ball is snapped to a holder who places the ball on the ground in an
            upright position and holds it for a kicker to kick through the field 
            goal posts on opposing sides of the field. If the ball goes through
            the kicking team is awarded three points. If the kicker misses the
            opposing team claims possesion at the line of scrimmage, unless the 
            ball doesn't cross the line of scrimmage and the team has at least
            one down left.

        <h2 id="penalties">Penalties</h2>
        <p>
            There are too many penalties in the sport of football for me to
            cover here. I will instead explain the most common penalties.
            Note that specifics of these penalties can differ by league.
            Perhaps the most common penalty is a false start. A false start
            occurs when a player on the offense gets set and then moves from
            their set position before the ball is set. Recievers are allowed
            to move before the ball is snapped even after entering a set position
            provided they are set for at least one second and move laterraly.
            Offsides is the complementary penalty for a false start. An Offsides
            occurs when the defense jumps across the line of scrimage before the 
            ball is snapped. The play is allowed to play out as long as the player's
            head start isn't., in the referees opinion, to drastic. both a false start
            and an offsides result in 5 yards being awarded to the opposing team.
            Holding is another common penalty. Holding occurs when a player grabs a 
            player or restrains the player outside of their center of mass. The play
            is allowed to play out even after holding has been called. Holding results
            in 10 yards being awarded to the opposing team. Pass interference occurs 
            when a player restrains or physically impedes a player from catching a 
            pass before that player has touched the ball. A player is allowed to be
            more physical if that player is making a play on the ball. a player is
            usually considered to be making a play on the ball if the players head 
            has located the ball and is actively tracking it. Pass interference can 
            be called on both the offense and the defense as both offensive and defensive 
            players are considered to have equal right to the ball. The amount of yards 
            awarded if pass interference is called on the defense differs by league,
            but it normally grants an automatic first down. The amount of yards awarded
            to the defense if it is called on the offense is 10 yards.
